# Dijkstra For Routers
Language used: Python 2.7


Using the Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm find the shortest path between each pair of nodes in a network. The graph is an undirected graph defined by a set of Nodes-N, a set of Routers-R, and set of Edges-E that connects N and R.

Nodes.txt ---> Contains all nodes.

Routers.txt ---> Contains all routers.

Edges.txt ---> Contains all possible connections.


1) Find the shortest path between nodes using Dijkstra Algorithm.
2) There are two modes of the program: list-all-paths and list_path_to


	
 Use the command: alias python2="python2.7"
--> Now, if you want to print all paths use python2 Dijkstra.py 1 and If you want a particular path from source to destination then use python2 Dijkstra.py 2 src dest 


replace the src and dest with suitable vertex from the given edges or nodes. 
The Program once compiled will give a message that the output file has been created and you can check the output in Routes.txt file.
