# Dijkstra For Routers
Language used: Python 2.7
The nodes are connected through routers, given all possible connections this program will find the shortest path between nodes using modified Dijkstra Algorithm.

Nodes.txt ---> Contains all nodes.
Routers.txt ---> Contains all routers.
Edges.txt ---> Contains all possible connections.


1) Find the shortest path between nodes using Dijkstra Algorithm.
2) There are two modes of the program: list-all-paths and list_path_to

	
 Use the command: alias python2="python2.7"
--> Now, if you want to print all paths use python2 Dijkstra.py 1 and If you want a particular path from source to destination then use python2 Dijkstra.py 2 src dest 
replace the src and dest with suitable vertex from the given edges or nodes. 
The Program once compiled will give a message that the output file has been created and you can check the output in Routes.txt file.
